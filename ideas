Physics Simulation: 

    1.  Projectile Motion
    Create a program that simulates the projectile motion of an object in a 2D space. 
    Use equations from classical mechanics to calculate the object's position, velocity, and acceleration at each time step.
    You can allow the user to input initial parameters such as angle, initial velocity, and launch height. 
    The program should display the trajectory of the projectile and provide information such as maximum height, range, and time of flight.

Mathematics: 

  1.  Matrix Calculator
    Develop a matrix calculator that allows users to perform various operations on matrices. 
    Implement functions for matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication, and inverse. 
    Additionally, incorporate mathematical operations such as finding the determinant, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. 
    The program should prompt the user for input matrices and display the results of the selected operation.
  
  2.  Polynomial Solver
    Create a program that solves quadratic equations and displays the roots.
    Extend it to handle cubic or higher-degree polynomials using appropriate mathematical methods (e.g., Newton's method or synthetic division).
    Implement string parsing to input polynomial coefficients and display the solution.

  3.  Fibonacci Sequence Generator
    Implement a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence.
    Allow the user to input a number, n, and generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.
    Utilize mathematical recursion or iterative techniques to calculate the sequence efficiently.
    Provide options for the user to display the sequence or calculate specific properties like the sum or average of the sequence.

    Additionally, you can extend this project by incorporating other mathematical concepts, such as:

    Prime Number Checker: Modify the Fibonacci sequence generator to check whether each number in the sequence is prime or composite. Display the results accordingly.
    Golden Ratio Calculator: Utilize the Fibonacci sequence to approximate the value of the golden ratio (phi). 
    Allow the user to specify the number of terms to be used in the approximation and display the result.
    Fibonacci Spiral: Implement a graphical representation of the Fibonacci sequence by drawing a spiral using squares with side lengths corresponding to consecutive Fibonacci numbers.

String Encryption/Decryption: 

  1.  Caesar Cipher
    Implement a program that encrypts and decrypts strings using the Caesar cipher technique. 
    The user should be able to input a string and specify the shift value (the number of positions each character should be shifted in the alphabet). 
    The program should then output the encrypted or decrypted string accordingly. 
    Make sure to handle both uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as wrap-around cases (e.g., shifting 'z' by 1 should result in 'a').

  2.  Word Game
    Create a word-based game that involves string manipulation and mathematical operations.
    For example, implement a game where players form words from given letters and earn points based on the word length or complexity.
    Incorporate mathematical challenges, such as finding anagrams, calculating word scores, or solving word puzzles.
