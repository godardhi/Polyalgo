Physics Simulation: 

Projectile Motion
Create a program that simulates the projectile motion of an object in a 2D space. 
Use equations from classical mechanics to calculate the object's position, velocity, and acceleration at each time step.
You can allow the user to input initial parameters such as angle, initial velocity, and launch height. 
The program should display the trajectory of the projectile and provide information such as maximum height, range, and time of flight.

Mathematics: Matrix Calculator

Develop a matrix calculator that allows users to perform various operations on matrices. 
Implement functions for matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication, and inverse. 
Additionally, incorporate mathematical operations such as finding the determinant, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. 
The program should prompt the user for input matrices and display the results of the selected operation.

String Encryption/Decryption: Caesar Cipher

Implement a program that encrypts and decrypts strings using the Caesar cipher technique. 
The user should be able to input a string and specify the shift value (the number of positions each character should be shifted in the alphabet). 
The program should then output the encrypted or decrypted string accordingly. 
Make sure to handle both uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as wrap-around cases (e.g., shifting 'z' by 1 should result in 'a').
